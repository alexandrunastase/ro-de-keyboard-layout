Basically it's the US International Layout + Romanian characters (ăâîșț) + German characters (äöüß)

#### Install and unistall for Arch Linux



```
make install
```

```
make uninstall
```

Keep in mind that for other distributions, like Fedora for example, the configuration can reside in `/etc/X11/xkb/` instead of `/usr/share/X11/xkb/`
